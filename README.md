# Cement_Strength_Prediction

This machine learning project aims to predict the strength of cement based on its various properties. The project uses data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms to develop a model that can accurately predict the strength of cement.

# Dataset
The data used in this project is the Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset. The dataset contains information on the various properties of cement such as cement, slag, ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. It also contains the target variable, which is the compressive strength of the cement.

# Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Conclusion

After training multiple machine learning models. The best performing model is a XGBoost Regression model with an accuracy of 94%. This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the strength of cement.
